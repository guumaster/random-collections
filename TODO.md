### Possible CLI ideas

dir-cleaner  # * [voidcosmos/npkill: List any node_modules directories in your system, as well as the space they take up. You can then select which ones you want to erase to free up space.](https://github.com/voidcosmos/npkill)
	- remove directories like npm_modules, 
	- remove all in .gitignore ?
	- dry-run to check what would be deleted

git changelog    # show a markdown output of commits with links
git authors list  # list all authors in markdown with links
git check-rebased  <branch>  # check if the current branch is rebased from dest branch
