### Plugins ideas

Inspired in Krew, plugin index is a central repo with a yaml/json file pointing to different plugins

- **etc-host** handle content of etc/host files with ease
	- list 
	- set/unset

- **alias** create ZETA shortcuts to specific plugins on an executable path
	- list
	- set/unset

- **git-changelog** reads commits and make a markdown changelog list (maybe with a template)

- **onboarding** (IGZ specific) help with introduction of new employee
	- web-draft: open a web editor to write your Markdown presentation
	- send PR
	- update PR

- **programs** (IGZ specific) help with program tasks
	- upload video
	- notify  send slack messages about coming talks and videos uploaded
